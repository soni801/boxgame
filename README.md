# The Box Game

Now, you may ask yourself, "what the fuck is this?" - and I don't know. The Box Game started out when I tried to learn
Java game dev many years ago. It was the first project I built myself without a tutorial. So, in other words, the code
is horrible. After some time I lost complete interest in the project, and it silently died.

Until recently. You see, [Extension](https://github.com/ExtensionL) was bored and asked me if I had something he could do. I told him "check out this
garbage game I made a while back" - and after trying to change his working directory for 11 minutes, he was on his way.
This also gave me a sudden burst of motivation to work on the game again, so here I am, 2 years later, providing updates
again.

### But what is the point of the game?

The Box Game is a 2D top down platformer game written in Java, and your objective is to get to the end of the labyrinth.
The game has 11 levels that get progressively larger each level. More gameplay elements will get introduced to you as
you go, and in total the game will take roughly 10-20 minutes to fully play through, depending on your skills (or maybe
luck?).

### How do I install this?

I'm glad you asked. First, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/soni801/boxgame/releases) page. The release
page should have both Linux and Windows binaries. If you own a Mac, first off, why? Second off, too bad. You really didn't
miss out anyway. After you have downloaded the binary, the procedure will vary depending on your OS. On Windows there
should be a `.exe` file in the root directory for you to open, meanwhile on linux the binary is located inside
`bin/`. You might need to run `chmod +x path/to/binary` to make it executable. After that, you can launch it. If it
doesn't work, cry to me on Discord @Soni#7454.

There will also be a platform-independent `.jar` file that you can download if you prefer that. This should also run on
macOS, although that has not been tested.
